# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting
This project analyzes Walmartâ€™s historical weekly sales data to identify patterns, factors affecting performance, and forecast future sales. Using data from multiple stores and departments, it explores the impact of holidays, markdown events, and economic conditions such as fuel price, CPI, and unemployment on sales trends.
